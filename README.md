# featureVectorBuilder
featureVectorBuilder is a project to generate Feature Vector of a given input text file. Feature vector is used as input to AutoWeka which would generate the Model that will be plugged into project that generates UML diagrams using ArgoUML.

To test the project, compile and run the file named feature_merged.java

Open source software that I have used to build the project are: Stanford CoreNLP, OpenIE, WordNet
